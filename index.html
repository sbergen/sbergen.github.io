      <p>
        I currently work at <a href="http://yousician.com/">Yousician</a> as a hands-on Application Architect and Team Lead.
        <br>
        I'm currently <em>not</em> actively looking for a new job, but here's my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sbergen/">LinkedIn</a> page, incase you are interested anyway.
      </p>

      <p>
        I mostly code in C# and C++ at work, and these days don't do much coding outside of work.
        When I do code on my free time, I usually play around with functional programming (mostly with <a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a>),
        study high performance tools like <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org">Rust</a>, or DSP related stuff like <a href="http://faust.grame.fr/">Faust</a>.
        You can find some of my past projects and open-source contributions on my <a href="https://github.com/sbergen">GitHub page</a>.
      </p>

        Outise of tech, my interest include music (producing, listening, playing bass and guitar), investing, and intermittently coffee and bicycles.

        This page mostly exists because I want to hold on to my domain name, and feel like I need to have something here :)
